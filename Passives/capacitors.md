# Capacitors

Below are my notes and cheat sheet material on capacitors for circuit board design.

## Ceramic Capacitors

Some characteristic features of ceramic capacitors are:
- They are non-polarized.
- They have a low equivalent series resistance (ESR).
- They have a low equivalent series inductance (ESL).
- They have significant voltage derating. 


Common uses of ceramic capacitors are line blocking, HF coupling, filtering, bypassing, etc.
